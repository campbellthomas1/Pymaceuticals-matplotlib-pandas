## Analysis
In this challenge I used data from 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors and recieved treament with different drugs. I was able to generate a summary of the statistics, create bar, pie, and scatter plots to better display the data, and calculate correlation and regression. The main goal was to look at Capomulin against other treatments.

## Findings
- The correlation between the weight of the mouse and the tumor volume is positive.
- The most number of mice tested were under and Ramicane, with the least number tested under Propriva.
- There were slightly more male mice tested than female so we can likely infer that gender did not skew the data.
